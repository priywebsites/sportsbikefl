Project Title: SportbikeFL Modern E-Commerce Redesign

The project must include:
A customer-facing e-commerce site (to browse motorcycles, parts, and accessories).

A direct owner login button in the header (with username/password: ronnie123).

‚ö° Prompt Instruction for Replit:
"Build a modern motorcycle e-commerce platform inspired by sportbikefl.com. Use React + Tailwind for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend, and SQLite for database. The site must have a customer-facing store (home, motorcycles, parts, accessories, cart/checkout) and an owner dashboard (login: ronnie123/ronnie123). Owner can add/edit/delete products, mark as sold, and apply discounts. Products must update dynamically from the database. Make the design sleek, responsive, and modern compared to the outdated current site."
