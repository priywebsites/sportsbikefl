✅ Booking System Requirements (Expanded & Refined)
1. Service Catalog
Each service (6 total) should include:
Name
Price (or “Call for price”)
Duration
“Book Now” button
2. Booking Flow
Click Book Now → opens booking modal/page.
Show calendar (date picker) → limited to store hours.
Show available time slots → based on service duration.
3. Store Hours & Time Zone
Timezone: Kissimmee, Florida (Eastern Time, EST/EDT).
Store Hours (assumed):
Mon–Fri: 9 AM – 6 PM
Sat: 9 AM – 5 PM
Sun: Closed
Calendar should block off all times outside these hours.
4. Slot Management
When a customer books a slot (e.g., 10–11 AM Tire Change):
That exact slot becomes unavailable for that service only.
Other services at that same time remain available.
Prevent double booking for the same service/time.
Save: service → date → time → customer data in database.
5. Customer Info Capture
After selecting service + time:
Ask for:
First Name
Last Name
Email
Phone Number
Validate phone + email.
Save booking to database.
6. Notifications (Future-Ready)
After booking:
Show confirmation page:
“Appointment confirmed for [Service] at [Time] on [Date].”
(Future) Send confirmation text message via Twilio:
Message to customer → “Your appointment is confirmed.”
Message to owner → “New booking: [Service] at [Time] by [Customer Name].”
For now: just ensure DB stores info and exposes booking events for Twilio integration.
7. Admin/Owner Management
Accessible inside Owner Login.
Features:
View all upcoming bookings.
Filter bookings by service/date.
Cancel/edit bookings if needed.

🔒 Prevent Past Bookings
The system must check current time in Kissimmee/Orlando, FL (Eastern Time Zone).
When rendering available slots:
Today’s date: Only show slots later than the current time.
Example: If it’s 11:00 AM local time, do not show 10:00 AM or earlier.
Future dates: Show all slots (within store hours).
Past dates: Should not be selectable in the calendar at all.
